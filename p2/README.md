## Notes for instructor
I used the design C pattern, along with Object Oriented Programming.  

The classes are organized like so:
`
Game --> instructions  
      --> players   ---> board
`

The bingo card is set up such that all cells on the board are submit buttons.
The Bingo, Next Call, and New Game buttons are also submit buttons.
